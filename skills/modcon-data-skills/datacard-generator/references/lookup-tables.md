## Datacard meta

### `datacard.creation_method`

How this datacard was most recently created or updated.

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Manual` | Filled out entirely by hand by a human author |
| `Automated` | Generated entirely by a pipeline, script, or AI model with no human review |
| `Hybrid` | Initially generated automatically, then reviewed and edited by a human (most common) |

### `datacard.created_by[].creator` — AgentClass type slots

`AgentClass` uses a tagged union: populate exactly one of the four slots below; leave the others null.

| Slot | When to populate |
|---|---|
| `person` | A named human contributor — fill `given_name`, `family_name`, `email`, `orcid`, `affiliation` |
| `organization` | A team or org without a named individual — fill `name` and `ror_id` |
| `ai_model` | An AI/LLM model (e.g., Claude, GPT-4) — fill `name`, `version`, `relationship` |
| `software` | An automated pipeline or script — fill `name`, `version`, `relationship` |

The `role[]` field on each agent uses the CRediT taxonomy (see People & Organizations section).

### `datacard.language`

ISO 639-1 two-letter code for the language of the datacard text. Free-text; no enum constraint.

Common values: `en` (English), `es` (Spanish), `fr` (French), `de` (German), `zh` (Chinese), `ja` (Japanese).

## Capability flags (NEW in v2)

Six `Yes | No` flags at the top level of `GenesisDatacardClass` gate which capability containers are required. All use `YesNoEnum`.

| Flag | Gates container | When to set `Yes` |
|---|---|---|
| `supports_discoverability` | `discoverability.*` | **Always Yes** — required by the schema for all datacards |
| `supports_accessibility` | `accessibility.*` | Dataset is shared or accessible to others (even internally) |
| `supports_interoperability` | `interoperability.*` | Dataset is intended to integrate with other datasets or systems |
| `supports_reusability` | `reusability.*` | Dataset may be reused by others; license and stewardship matter |

| `supports_ai_usability` | `ai_usability.*` | Dataset is intended for AI/ML training, evaluation, or inference |

Setting a flag to `Yes` makes the corresponding container required in the schema.

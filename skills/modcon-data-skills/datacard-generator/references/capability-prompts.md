# Capability prompt batches

Per-capability field-prompt sequences used by SKILL.md (workflow step 6) when
interactively filling a datacard. Batches are 1–5 fields each and ordered
roughly by how often the answer is already known.

Each top-level key in the YAML below is a `supports_*` capability. The skill
loads ONLY the sections for capabilities the user opted into via the
`supports_*` flags in step 1. `discoverability` is always loaded (it is
schema-forced to Yes).

For comprehensive enum values, see `references/lookup-tables.md`.

# Generating Datacards

Generate a Genesis Mission Datacard v1.2 by introspecting a dataset
directory and filling both the YAML frontmatter and the markdown narrative
body of the canonical template, prompting the user for fields that
introspection can't infer.

The skill also has a one-shot **Convert** path for migrating an existing
MODCON v1 datacard to Genesis v1.2.

**Validation is driven by the upstream Pydantic model** (`scripts/genesis_models.py`)
applied via `scripts/validate_datacard.py`. The few warn-level rules the
model cannot express live in `references/validation-rules.md`.

## Workflow

Copy this checklist and check off steps as you go.

```
Progress:
- [ ] 1. Gather context (dataset_path now; `supports_*` capabilities after step 2, with evidence)
- [ ] 2. Run python3 scripts/introspect.py on the dataset directory
- [ ] 3. Load capability-specific guidance
- [ ] 4. Auto-fill YAML from introspect output
- [ ] 5. Confirm dataset readiness level with the user (optional)
- [ ] 6. Prompt for remaining required fields in batches
- [ ] 7. Cross-check every ORCID/ROR/DOI/OSTI identifier via live APIs
- [ ] 8. Compute filename and write the datacard (YAML + markdown body)
- [ ] 9. Run scripts/validate_datacard.py
- [ ] 10. Address findings; re-validate
- [ ] 11. Present review summary
```

### 1. Gather context

**Ask for the dataset path now.** Do not answer the capability questions
below cold — first run step 2 (introspect), then come back and propose
each `supports_*` answer with evidence from what introspection found,
rather than interrogating the user blind before any evidence exists.

- **Dataset path** — directory to document. Ask for this now.
- **Which capabilities does this dataset support?** (ask this after step 2,
  once introspection evidence is in hand — see the note at the end of
  step 2). Genesis v1.2 organizes fields into six capability containers.
  Propose a default for each, backed by an introspection finding, and ask
  the user to confirm Yes/No:
  - `supports_discoverability` — **always Yes** (schema enforces this). Identification, description, project, release status, contacts, authorship. Minimum core fields.
  - `supports_accessibility` — Yes if the dataset is meant to be accessed/shared. Adds access policy, endpoints, dataset scale.
  - `supports_interoperability` — Yes if the dataset uses standard formats, structured features, controlled vocabularies, or has documented provenance. Adds data_structure, dates, semantic_layer, provenance, related_resources.
  - `supports_reusability` — Yes if the dataset is licensed for downstream use. Adds license, citation, integrity, stewardship, data_quality.
  - `supports_governed_use` — Yes if the dataset has access restrictions, PII, export control, or formal review requirements. Adds use_governance, security/sensitivity blocks, compliance, review_provenance_companion.
  - `supports_ai_usability` — Yes if the dataset is suitable for AI/ML training, inference, or evaluation. Adds ai_usage policy block.

Each `supports_X = Yes` triggers a required `X` block in the YAML and a corresponding set of required fields. Each `supports_X = No` omits that block entirely.

### 2. Introspect the directory

Run `python3 scripts/introspect.py <dataset_path>` and capture the JSON. See
[references/introspection-commands.md](references/introspection-commands.md) for
what each output field means.

**Now return to the capability questions from step 1.** Propose an answer
for each `supports_*` flag backed by an introspection finding — e.g., "I
found a LICENSE file and CITATION.cff → I recommend
`supports_reusability=Yes`. No `train/`/`test/` splits detected →
`supports_ai_usability` optional." Confirm each with the user
([Yes/No]) before moving on to step 3.

### 3. Load capability-specific guidance

Read `references/capability-prompts.md` (the per-capability prompt sequence).

For deep field-by-field explanation, load the relevant section of
`references/genesis_field_guide.md` only as needed (the file is large).

### 4. Auto-fill the data card

Copy the template to the output filename **without reading it into
context**:

```bash
# Use the ABSOLUTE path to the template (works regardless of your cwd).
# If the skill is installed under ~/.claude/skills/, the path is
# ~/.claude/skills/datacard-generator/references/genesis_v1.0_template.md.
# In this repo, it's <repo_root>/skills/datacard-generator/references/genesis_v1.0_template.md.
cp <template_absolute_path> <output_path>
```

Then edit the copied file with targeted `sed`/patch operations to fill YAML
fields and markdown body regions — do NOT regenerate the entire file. Read
only the sections you need to modify (typically the YAML frontmatter's ~1,140
lines and specific markdown body sections via `sed -n 'START,ENDp'`). The
template is over 130KB / ~35K tokens; a naive full read blows the context
budget.

**Where to save:** inside `<dataset_dir>/` by default; ask if the user
prefers elsewhere. Compute the filename via the Filename rule (§8 below).

Populate the YAML frontmatter
using this decision table (paths use v2 capability-container structure):

| Genesis field | Auto-fill if… | Otherwise |
|---|---|---|
| `discoverability.datacard.created_date` | always (today, ISO 8601) | — |
| `discoverability.datacard.updated_date` | `if_applicable` — leave blank on initial creation; only set on subsequent edits (see Gotcha below) | — |
| `discoverability.datacard.creation_method` | always → `"Hybrid"` (Title case in v2) | — |
| `discoverability.datacard.template_version` | always → `"1.2"` (matches the vendored schema/template version) | — |
| `discoverability.datacard.change_log[0]` | always (`change_date`, `datacard_version: "1.2"`, "Initial creation" or "Converted from MODCON v1") | — |
| `discoverability.datacard.filename` | computed from `discoverability.identification.name` (see Filename rule below) | — |
| `discoverability.datacard.language` | always → `en` (override if README is non-English) | — |
| `discoverability.datacard.created_by[]` | always (AI model first if Hybrid; see `references/gotchas.md`) | — |
| `discoverability.identification.name` | from README / CITATION.cff title | prompt |
| `discoverability.identification.version` | from CITATION.cff or default `"1.0"` | prompt |
| `discoverability.product_type` | never — `ProductTypeEnum` (see `references/lookup-tables.md`) | always prompt |
| `discoverability.datacard.id` | never — `IdentifierClass` (`{type: local, value: <slug>}` for pre-publication is a sensible default) | prompt |
| `discoverability.dataset_description.dataset_summary` | from README first paragraph | prompt |
| `discoverability.dataset_description.keywords` | from README / CITATION.cff | prompt |
| `interoperability.data_structure.formats` | introspect.py `formats` | prompt (requires `supports_interoperability=Yes`) |
| `interoperability.data_structure.features` | introspect.py `sample_columns` (structured form: `- name: x` objects) | prompt |
| `interoperability.data_structure.splits` | introspect.py `splits_detected` | leave empty |
| `accessibility.dataset_scale.record_count` / `.compressed_bytes` | introspect.py | prompt (requires `supports_accessibility=Yes`) |
| `reusability.license.spdx_id` | introspect.py `license_hint` | prompt (requires `supports_reusability=Yes`) |
| `reusability.license.name` | never | prompt whenever the `reusability.license` block is emitted (Pydantic requires it always, not just when `spdx_id=other`) |
| `discoverability.authors[]` | from CITATION.cff (use **CRediT roles** — see `references/lookup-tables.md`) | prompt |
| `reusability.citation.preferred_citation` | from CITATION.cff bibtex | prompt at `[pub]` |
| `interoperability.provenance.was_generated_by` | always prompt (often forgotten) | — |
| `discoverability.dataset_description.science_domain` | never auto-filled — closed `ScienceDomainEnum` (see `references/lookup-tables.md`) | prompt |
| `ai_usability.ai_usage.training_use_status` / `.inference_use_status` / `.evaluation_use_status` | never auto-filled | prompt (`Yes \| No \| Conditional`); if `Conditional`, also prompt for the matching `*_use_conditions` free-text field |
| `_repository.*` | **NEVER** — system-owned | — |

For each `supports_X=Yes`, also write `supports_X: "Yes"` at the top level
of the YAML. The schema (via Pydantic) enforces that the matching `X:` block
must exist when `supports_X=Yes`.

ORCID, ROR, DOI, and OSTI award numbers gathered here will be
**cross-checked against their public APIs in step 7** — not optional.
Format validation is handled automatically by the validator.

### 5. Confirm dataset readiness level (optional)

If the user wants to indicate dataset readiness, ask them to set a level
(1, 2, or 3) as freetext in the datacard narrative. There is no dedicated
`dataset_readiness` YAML field in Genesis v1.2 — readiness is expressed
through the combination of `supports_*` flags that are set to `"Yes"`.

As a heuristic to guide the user (also expressible as a rough count of
`supports_*` flags set to Yes: 1 typically maps to level 1, 2-3 to level 2,
>= 4 to level 3):

- 1 = Discoverable (metadata only; `supports_discoverability=Yes` + perhaps `accessibility`)
- 2 = Interoperable & Reusable (also license, contacts, provenance; `supports_interoperability` and `supports_reusability`)
- 3 = AI-Ready & Trustworthy (also semantic layer, integrity, governed use; `supports_ai_usability` or `supports_governed_use`)

Confirm with the user.

### 6. Prompt for missing fields

Present auto-discovered values for confirmation. Then ask for unfilled
required fields. Ask **3-5 at a time** following the batches in
`references/capability-prompts.md`. Stop and confirm after each batch.

**Key vocabulary changes in v2** (full list in `references/lookup-tables.md`):

- **CRediT taxonomy** for `authors[].person.role` / `.organization.role` and
  `contributors[].person.role` / `.organization.role` (role[] lives **inside**
  the agent sub-block — see Gotcha below) —
  `Conceptualization`, `Data_Curation`, `Data_Collection`, `Formal_Analysis`,
  `Funding_Acquisition`, `Investigation`, `Methodology`, `Project_Administration`,
  `Resources`, `Software`, `Supervision`, `Validation`, `Visualization`,
  `Writing_Original_Draft`, `Writing_Review_Editing`, `Other` (16 values). **Multi-valued
  per author.** Replaces our previous `creator | contributor | data_collector | curator | publisher | sponsor | other` list.
- **Title_Case for all enums** — `Published` not `published`, `Draft` not `draft`, `Hybrid` not `hybrid`, etc.
- **Sensitivity** is no longer a tier ladder. Use `OverallSensitivityEnum`:
  `Public | Unclassified_Uncontrolled | CUI | UCNI | Classified | Legacy_Controlled | Mixed | Other_Controlled`.
- **Yes/No/Conditional** strings (not Python booleans) for
  `ai_usability.ai_usage.training_use_status` / `.inference_use_status` /
  `.evaluation_use_status` (renamed from `*_use_allowed`) and governance
  Yes/No fields. If any `*_use_status = "Conditional"`, the matching
  `*_use_conditions` free-text field is required.
- **`science_domain` is a closed enum** (`ScienceDomainEnum`, 15 values) —
  see `references/lookup-tables.md`. No longer free text.

### 7. Cross-check identifiers via live APIs

**Step 7 is not optional. Do not proceed to step 8 (write) without
completing it.** Datacards with unverified identifiers can silently
misattribute authorship, funding, or DOIs — worse than a
slightly-incomplete card.

For EVERY ORCID, ROR, DOI, and OSTI award number in the datacard —
whether the user provided it or introspection inferred it — resolve it
against the public API per `references/live-enrichment.md`. **Do not
skip this step.** Run it even when the field is already populated.

Enrich every path listed under "Identifier paths to check" in
`references/live-enrichment.md`. The list is grouped by capability so you
can skip capabilities the user opted out of.

For each lookup:

- **Clean match** — silent pass.
- **Mismatch** — present both side-by-side, ask the user.
- **Datacard incomplete** — API has fields the datacard doesn't; offer to add.
- **Does not resolve** (404, error) — warn the user; likely typo.
- **Rate-limited** — retry once; if still failing, log and move on.
- **Widespread network failure** — if more than 2-3 lookups in a row fail
  with connection/network errors (not per-ID 404s), stop enrichment, tell
  the user that live enrichment could not run, and **mark the datacard as
  unverified** in the review summary at step 11. Do not proceed to step 8
  (write) with silently unverified identifiers.

Present ALL findings from all identifiers to the user as a single
consolidated table (see `references/live-enrichment.md` § Batching
guidance). Do NOT prompt after each individual lookup — batch the
WebFetch calls, then present one summary.

Use `WebFetch`. Endpoints in [references/live-enrichment.md](references/live-enrichment.md).

### 8. Filename + write

**Filename rule:** `genesis_datacard_<snake_case(discoverability.identification.name)>.md`,
where `snake_case` lowercases the name and replaces any non-alphanumeric
run with a single `_`.

**Where to save:** inside `<dataset_dir>/` by default; ask if the user
prefers elsewhere.

**What to write:** the canonical template
(`references/genesis_v1.0_template.md`) with **both halves filled**:

- **YAML frontmatter** — fully populated from the workflow above. Set
  `supports_discoverability: "Yes"` and any other `supports_X: "Yes"` the
  user opted into; omit the corresponding `X:` block (or set
  `supports_X: "No"`) for capabilities the user opted out of.
- **Markdown narrative body** — also fully filled. See
  [references/body-fill-guide.md](references/body-fill-guide.md) for the
  section-by-section mapping.

**Strip all placeholder markup before saving.** No `[!TODO]`, `<REPLACE:>`,
`<INSTRUCTIONS:>`, `<metadata_key:>`, `${VARIABLE}`, or `__VALUE__` tokens
should remain. Verify with:
`grep -E '\[!TODO\]|<REPLACE:|<INSTRUCTIONS:|<metadata_key:|\$\{|__VALUE__' <output_file>`

### 9. Validate

Run:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_datacard.py <written_file>
```

The validator emits structured codes:

- `MISSING_REQUIRED:<field>` — re-prompt
- `BAD_ENUM:<field>` — show enum from `references/lookup-tables.md`; re-prompt
- `BAD_FORMAT:<field>` — show format hint; re-prompt
- `INCONSISTENT:<field>` — show conflicting values; ask user
- `SCHEMA_VIOLATION:<field>` — unexpected; investigate

Use `--json` to get machine-readable output for parsing the findings list.

### 10. Address findings

Loop steps 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 until `--json` output has `"ok": true`. **Do not
claim done with un-addressed errors.** `warn` severity findings can stand
in the review summary but errors must be resolved.

On loop-back to step 7, re-enrich ONLY identifiers the user added or
changed in this iteration — do NOT re-check every identifier from scratch
(see `references/live-enrichment.md` § Re-check-only-changed).

### 11. Review summary

Present:
- Auto-populated fields (count + brief list)
- User-provided fields (count + brief list)
- Empty / `not_applicable` fields (with reason)
- Validator warnings (e.g., filename alignment, workflow↔release alignment)
- Suggestions for improvement (e.g., add `reusability.data_quality.completeness` if
  reusability is supported and the field is empty)

Ask if the user wants to revise any section before finishing.

## Convert path (MODCON v1 → Genesis v1.2)

When the user asks to convert an existing MODCON v1 datacard:

1. Run `python3 scripts/convert_v1_to_genesis.py <v1_path> --json` and capture the JSON report. The report has three lists:
   - `mapped` — fields the converter populated.
   - `missing_required` — Genesis fields the converter couldn't map. **Iterate over this list and prompt the user.**
   - `orphans` — v1 fields with no v2 equivalent.
2. After prompting the user for the fields in `missing_required`, **compose
   the final YAML inline** — apply the answered values to the converter's
   `mapped` output. Do NOT rerun `convert_v1_to_genesis.py` after prompts;
   the converter only reads the v1 source and cannot re-integrate user
   answers.
3. Set `discoverability.datacard.creation_method = "Hybrid"`, `template_version = "1.2"`, and ensure
   `change_log[0] = {change_date: today, datacard_version: "1.2", summary: "Converted from MODCON v1"}`.
4. **Fill the markdown body** using `references/body-fill-guide.md`.
5. **Cross-check every identifier via live APIs** (step 7 of the Generate path).
6. **Compute the filename and write the datacard** (step 8 of the Generate path).
7. Run the validator (step 9 of the Generate path).
8. Present the review summary (step 11 of the Generate path).

## Gotchas (read before generating)

For additional gotchas (chronological ordering, `ai_model`/`software`
relationship requirement, etc.), see
[references/gotchas.md](references/gotchas.md).

1. **`workflow.state` ≠ `release_status`.** Both are needed (under
   `discoverability.workflow.state` and `discoverability.release_status`).
   Recommended alignments are in `references/lookup-tables.md`.

2. **Sensitivity is no longer a tier ladder.** Use
   `OverallSensitivityEnum` (`Public | Unclassified_Uncontrolled | CUI |
   UCNI | Classified | Legacy_Controlled | Mixed | Other_Controlled`) on
   both `discoverability.datacard.sensitivity.overall_sensitivity` (the
   document) and `discoverability.sensitivity.overall_sensitivity` (the
   dataset). These are independent and often differ — never default them
   to match.

3. **`primary_id.type`** should not be `doi` before a DOI is minted.
   Use `ark`, `local`, or `unregistered` for pre-publication states.

4. **`provenance.was_generated_by`** is required (when
   `supports_interoperability=Yes`) and often forgotten. Even a one-line
   answer adds catalog value.

5. **`change_log` is append-only.** On re-runs, add a new entry plus
   `updated_date` bump. Never edit or delete prior entries. The field
   name inside each entry is `datacard_version` (patched locally from an
   upstream typo).

6. **`_repository` block is system-owned.** Do not populate. Leave it
   as-is in the template (the underscore prefix is the parser signal).

7. **`supports_discoverability` is always `"Yes"`.** The schema (via
   Pydantic) enforces this — every Genesis datacard has at least the
   discoverability block.

8. **`role[]` lives INSIDE the agent sub-block, not on the agent entry
   itself.** `AgentClass` (used by `created_by`, `contact`,
   `additional_contacts`, `authors`, `contributors`, `facilities`,
   `related_resources.software|ai_models`) has no top-level `role` slot —
   it is a tagged union of `person` / `organization` / `ai_model` /
   `software`, and each of those four sub-classes carries its own `role[]`
   (CRediT taxonomy). Do **not** write `role:` as a sibling of `person:`.
   Correct shape:
   ```yaml
   - contribution_date: "2026-07-01"
     creator:
       person:
         given_name: "Jane"
         family_name: "Doe"
         role: [Conceptualization, Data_Curation]   # inside person, not sibling
   ```

9. **`science_domain` is a closed, quoted-string-with-spaces enum.**
   `discoverability.dataset_description.science_domain` and
   `interoperability.domain_metadata.science_domain` both use
   `ScienceDomainEnum`, unlike every other enum in the schema which uses
   `Title_Case` / `snake_case` tokens. See `references/lookup-tables.md`
   for the full list. Free text is no longer accepted.

10. **`discoverability.datacard.updated_date` is now `if_applicable`, not
    required.** Leave it blank on initial creation (a datacard that has
    never been updated has nothing to report). Only set it when performing
    a genuine update to an existing datacard, alongside a new `change_log`
    entry (see Gotcha #5).

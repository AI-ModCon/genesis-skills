# Live Enrichment Reference

**This step is not optional.** SKILL.md workflow step 7 is a required stop.
Skipping enrichment produces datacards where a typo'd ORCID resolves to the
wrong human and no one catches it until publication. The API round-trips
cost a handful of seconds; that's cheaper than a wrong-authorship
correction post-publication.

The skill's workflow step 7 ("Cross-check identifiers via live APIs") resolves every ORCID, ROR, DOI, and OSTI award number in the datacard against its public API — **even when the user already provided a value**. The goal is two-fold: (1) fill missing fields the authoritative source has (affiliations, names, emails), and (2) catch mistyped identifiers that would otherwise resolve to the wrong entity or 404 silently. This file is the agent's guide to those APIs. Use the `WebFetch` tool for all live calls.

Treat every resolved value as a candidate for cross-check, not as authoritative. When the API returns a value that conflicts with the datacard, **present both to the user** rather than silently overwriting.

Format validation (ORCID/ROR regex patterns) lives in the Pydantic model at `scripts/genesis_models.py` (e.g., `PersonClass.orcid` and `AffiliationClass.ror_id` field patterns) and is enforced automatically by `scripts/validate_datacard.py`. This doc covers only the unique value-add: checksum verification, live API endpoints, DOE-specific OSTI guidance, and rate-limit compliance.

## Identifier paths to check (by capability)

Enrich every path below that is present in the datacard. The list is
grouped by capability so you can skip capabilities the user opted out of
(`supports_X = No`).

**`discoverability` (always present):**

- Every `discoverability.authors[].person.orcid` and `…person.affiliation.ror_id`
- Every `discoverability.authors[].organization.ror_id`
- Every `discoverability.contributors[].person.orcid` and `…ror_id`
- `discoverability.contact.person.orcid` and `…ror_id`
- Every `discoverability.additional_contacts[].person.orcid` and `…ror_id`
- Every `discoverability.sponsor_organizations[].ror_id` and `…award_number` (the latter via OSTI)
- Every `discoverability.research_organizations[].ror_id`
- Every `discoverability.facilities[].ror_id` and `…location.ror_id`
- `discoverability.identification.primary_id.value` (if `type: doi`)
- Every `discoverability.identification.additional_ids[].value` of type `doi`

**`reusability` (when `supports_reusability=Yes`):**

- `reusability.stewardship.maintainer.person.orcid` and `…ror_id`

**`governed_use` (when `supports_governed_use=Yes`):**

- Every `governed_use.review_provenance_companion[].reviewed_by.person.orcid`

**`interoperability` (when `supports_interoperability=Yes`):**

- Every `interoperability.related_resources.datasets[].identifier.value` (if `type: doi`)
- Every `interoperability.related_resources.publications[].value` (if `type: doi` — the only `IdentifierTypeEnum` value cross-checked here)

For each lookup, classify the outcome as one of: **Clean match** (silent
pass), **Mismatch** (present both side-by-side, ask the user), **Datacard
incomplete** (API has fields the datacard doesn't; offer to add), **Does
not resolve** (404/error; warn the user — likely typo), or **Rate-limited**
(retry once; if still failing, log and move on).

## ORCID

**Rate limit**: The public ORCID API (`pub.orcid.org`) has no published
per-second limit but returns HTTP 429 under heavy load. Space calls at
~1/sec to be safe. Persistent 429s should back off exponentially.

### Checksum verification (ISO 7064 MOD 11-2)

Before calling the API, you can self-check an ORCID without a network round-trip. Take the first 15 digits, run the algorithm below, and compare to the 16th character (which may be `X` = 10).

```
total = 0
for each of the first 15 digits d:
    total = (total + d) * 2
remainder = total % 11
result = (12 - remainder) % 11   # 10 → "X", else digit
```

If the checksum fails, warn the user before proceeding.

### Live Lookup

```
GET https://pub.orcid.org/v3.0/{orcid}/person
Headers: Accept: application/json
```

On success, extract:
- `name.given-names.value` → `person.given_name`
- `name.family-name.value` → `person.family_name`
- `emails.email[0].email` → `person.email` (only if visibility = `PUBLIC`)
- `researcher-urls.researcher-url[].url.value` — look for an institutional URL if affiliation is absent

For affiliation, also fetch:
```
GET https://pub.orcid.org/v3.0/{orcid}/employments
Headers: Accept: application/json
```
Use the most recent employment's:
- `organization.name` → `person.affiliation.name`
- `organization.disambiguated-organization.disambiguated-organization-identifier` (if `disambiguated-organization-source` is `ROR`) → `person.affiliation.ror_id` (store in URL form, `https://ror.org/XXXXXXX`)

**Present confirmed values to the user before writing them to the card.**

---

## ROR

**Rate limit:** 2000 requests per 5-minute rolling window (~6.7 req/s), no API key required (https://ror.readme.io/docs/rest-api). Space lookups ~1/sec to stay well under this.

**Deprecation status (network-verified 2026-07-02):** ROR API v1 was sunset the week of 2025-12-08. Any request with an explicit `/v1/` path now returns `HTTP 410 Gone`:
```json
{"errors":[{"status":"410","title":"API Version Deprecated","detail":"The v1 API has been deprecated. Please migrate to v2.","deprecated_at":"2025-12-09"}]}
```
Requests to the version-less path (`https://api.ror.org/organizations/{id}`) now default to the **v2** response shape (confirmed live). Use the version-less or explicit `/v2/` path below — never `/v1/`.

### Storage convention

ROR identifiers are stored in **URL form** (`https://ror.org/XXXXXXX`) per the Genesis template. The format regex is in `scripts/genesis_models.py` (`AffiliationClass.ror_id`). When a user provides a bare 9-character ID (e.g., `03yrm5c26`), prepend `https://ror.org/` before storing.

### Live Lookup

The ROR API expects the bare 9-character ID, not the URL form. Strip the `https://ror.org/` prefix when querying, but **store** the URL form in the datacard.

```
GET https://api.ror.org/v2/organizations/{bare_id}
```

On success, extract (v2 schema — field names changed from v1):
- `names[]` → find the entry whose `types[]` includes `"ror_display"` and use its `value` → the `name` field of whichever sub-block holds this ROR ID — e.g. `person.affiliation.name`, `organization.name`, `discoverability.sponsor_organizations[].name`, `discoverability.research_organizations[].name`, or `discoverability.facilities[].name`
- `locations[0].geonames_details.country_name` — useful context for the user (v1 was `country.country_name`)
- `types[]` — e.g., `["Education"]`, `["Government"]` (unchanged from v1)
- `links[]` → find the entry with `type == "website"` and use its `value` (v1 was a bare array of URL strings; v2 wraps each link in `{type, value}`)

**Present the resolved name to the user for confirmation** — ROR IDs can be mistyped and resolve to the wrong institution.

## OSTI

OSTI (Office of Scientific and Technical Information) provides a public REST API for DOE-funded research outputs including datasets, reports, and journal articles. Use it to pre-fill funding and provenance fields.

**Rate limit:** No numeric rate limit is published in the OSTI API docs, FAQs, or api-help pages (checked 2026-07-02). The sibling `/api/v1/records` (reports/publications) endpoint does return an `x-rate-limit-remaining` response header, so some throttling exists even where undocumented — space requests ~1/sec to stay well under a conservative ~5 req/s ceiling.

**Verified 2026-07-02:** `https://www.osti.gov/api/v1/datasets` returns **HTTP 404** — this endpoint does not exist. The correct dataset-search endpoint is the DOE Data Explorer API:

```
GET https://www.osti.gov/dataexplorer/api/v1/records?{params}
Headers: Accept: application/json
```

Documented query parameters (https://www.osti.gov/dataexplorer/api/v1/docs): `q`, `osti_id`, `fulltext`, `biblio`, `author`, `title`, `identifier`, `sponsor_org`, `research_org`, `contributing_org`, `source_id`, `publication_date_start`/`_end`, `entry_date_start`/`_end`, `language`, `country`, `site_ownership_code`, `sort`, `order`, `rows`, `page`.

**`award_number` and `site_url` are NOT functional filters** — verified empirically: passing either as a query param is silently ignored, and the endpoint returns its default (most-recent) result set instead of a 400/404 or a filtered match. Do not rely on them for lookup. `doi` filtering **does** work (verified with both a real DOI match and a fabricated DOI returning `[]`).

### Lookup by DOI (the only reliably filterable identifier)

If the dataset already has a DOI:
```
GET https://www.osti.gov/dataexplorer/api/v1/records?doi={doi}
```

On success, extract from the first matching record:
- `sponsor_orgs[]` → `discoverability.sponsor_organizations[].name` (array of strings — the response field is `sponsor_orgs`, not `sponsor_org`)
- `doe_contract_number` → `discoverability.sponsor_organizations[].award_number` (there is no separate `award_number` field in the response; DOE contract numbers are the closest available match — OSTI sometimes appends a trailing `; `, trim it)
- `research_orgs[]` → `discoverability.research_organizations[].name` (array of strings — the response field is `research_orgs`, not `research_org`)
- `site_url` / `doi` → cross-check against `discoverability.identification.primary_id.value` and `discoverability.identification.additional_ids[]`
- `title` — cross-check against `discoverability.identification.name`
- `authors[]` — array of formatted strings, e.g. `"Flynn, James (ORCID:0000000288355898)"`, not `{first_name, last_name}` objects; parse the name before the parenthetical, and reformat the digits after `ORCID:` into `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` before storing
- `description` — can seed `discoverability.dataset_description.dataset_summary` if none exists
- `publication_date` → `interoperability.dates.issued` (requires `supports_interoperability=Yes`)
- `subjects[]` → `discoverability.dataset_description.keywords` (the response field is `subjects`, not `keywords`)

Also consider whether the resolved DOI belongs in
`reusability.citation.preferred_citation` (the BibTeX-style block: `doi`,
`title`, `author`, `year`, `publisher`, `url`) if a preferred citation
isn't already set.

### Lookup by organization or title (when no DOI is available)

Since there is no server-side award-number or site-url filter, search on a supported parameter instead and manually scan the results:
```
GET https://www.osti.gov/dataexplorer/api/v1/records?sponsor_org={org_name}&rows=20
GET https://www.osti.gov/dataexplorer/api/v1/records?research_org={org_name}&rows=20
GET https://www.osti.gov/dataexplorer/api/v1/records?title={title_text}&rows=20
```
Page through results (`rows`/`page`) and match on `doe_contract_number` or `site_url` in the returned records.

### Usage Notes

- OSTI records are DOE-funded work. If there is no match, the dataset may not be DOE-funded or may not yet be registered — inform the user rather than leaving the field blank silently.
- Award numbers follow no single format: `DE-SC0012345`, `DE-AC02-06CH11357`, `89243021CSC000001` are all valid DOE patterns. Since `award_number` isn't a queryable filter, use these only for manual matching against `doe_contract_number`, not as a URL parameter.
- If multiple records match, present the list to the user and ask them to confirm which applies.
- The OSTI API returns JSON by default; no API key is required for read access.

## Batching guidance

When step 7 runs, resolve ALL identifiers first (batch the WebFetch calls)
THEN present a single consolidated diff table to the user showing every
mismatch, missing-field, and unresolvable ID at once. Do NOT interactively
prompt after each individual lookup — that produces 15+ pauses per
datacard and destroys the user experience.

**Batched ≠ parallel.** Batch means "no user prompts between individual
lookups"; you should still space calls to respect each API's rate limit
(see the per-API sections below). Firing 15 WebFetch calls in parallel
will trigger HTTP 429 on OSTI and burn through ROR's 5-min window.

Consolidated table format:

| Field | Current value | Resolved value | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| authors[0].person.orcid | 0000-0002-1234-5678 | (name mismatch: J. Doe vs Jane Smith) | Choose which |
| contact.person.affiliation.ror_id | https://ror.org/03yrm5c26 | ✓ resolves to "MIT" | (silent pass) |
| sponsor_organizations[0].award_number | DE-SC0012345 | (not found in OSTI) | Confirm typo? |

## Re-check-only-changed on validation loops

When step 10 (Address findings) loops back to step 7 after re-prompting
for values in step 6: re-enrich ONLY identifiers the user added or changed
in this iteration. Do not re-check every identifier from scratch — that's
wasteful and produces the same passing lookups repeatedly.
